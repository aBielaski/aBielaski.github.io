        human by shedding their skin when they leave the sea). Because Selkieâ€™s are charming and hardworking, the family who the Selkie was living with moved its 
        sealskin across town to keep the Selkie from going back to the sea. The Selkie must battle opponents along the way to get it back but can enlist the help 
        of other mythological creatures (that the player has in their card deck). The screen prototypes below were designed by me and are for the use cases: purchasing 
        a card package & playing the single player story mode. My inspiration behind this design was a blue water background for the seal, the gold border for ancient 
        mythology, and the land is an image of Ireland because it was ancient *Irish* mythology. <br>

        to find the best and biggest listings. There are lots of filter options on the left side, as well as click-to-filter functionality which also adjusts the other graphs when one 
        data section is selected.

        <u>Health Tracker:</u> <br>
        After learning dashboard design best practices, I put this design together with a few colours and ample whitespace to prevent the user from becoming overwhelmed. I decided
        on a green theme because healthiness is associated with green vegetables. Red was used as a warning/alert to identify when key performance indicators/goals are not being 
        met. There are settings icons which allow the user to adjust the time frames/intervals to their liking if they want to explore further as well. Otherwise, appropriate graph types
        were chosen and everything was labelled for clarity.
