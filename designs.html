            <h2> Prototyped Mobile App Game Design 1 - Selkie Quest </h2>

            <p> 
                In this project, my group needed to create a game related to Selkies (an ancient Irish mythological creature that can 
                shift from seal to human by shedding their skin when they leave the sea).  Because Selkieâ€™s are charming and hardworking,
                the family who the Selkie was living with moved its sealskin across town to keep the Selkie from going back to the sea.  The Selkie must battle opponents
                along the way to get it back but can enlist the help of other mythological creatures (that the player has in their card deck).  The screen prototypes below 
                were designed by me and are for the use cases: purchasing a card package & playing the single player story mode.  My inspiration behind this design was a blue 
                water background for the seal, the gold border for ancient mythology, and the land is an image of Ireland because it was ancient *Irish* mythology.

            <h2> Prototyped Mobile App Game Design 2 - Turn Up the Heat! </h2>

            <p> 
                This prototype was developed for a telepathic game called "Turn Up the Heat!" In this use case, one player chooses a fish and the other player
                has to try and guess the same fish/target.  Each time they are wrong, their brain heats up and once the match is over, the loser's mind is blown up.

            <h2> Prototyped Mobile App Design - Change-It-Up </h2>

            <p> 
                Below is my design for an application in which users can upload pictures of their clothes and put outfits together.  The app keeps track of when 
                something was worn last and will generate outfit suggestions that haven't been worn in a while (based on the weather) to remove the morning stress of trying to think of something new to wear.

            <p> 
                This children's book about a fish getting scared and seeking therapy was written and illustrated by me.  The images were created using the curvature pen tool, 
                the brush tool, effects/filters, gradients, etc.

                A website poster for a new type of 'hot chocolate' (the theme given to us). I included an image with a frothy texture, a fireplace background, and a snow sprinkle effect
                to encourage the viewer to think of that warm feeling they get when drinking hot chocolate by the fireplace on a cold, snowy night.

            <p> 
                An advertisement for the service of hair colouring/dye at a salon.  I took a normal portrait of a girl and used the image trace function in Illustrator, set to black and
                white.  This removed the body and allowed me to draw focus to the hair and segment the image to colour individual strands.

            <p> 
                An illustration created by me in which the lifejacket is around the ocean to signify that we need to protect it.  Since the main theme was the ocean,
                I used the image trace function to separate the land segments and then created a clipping mask to display fishes underneath the ocean in place of the land.
                I drew the lifejacket myself using the curvature tool.

                This photo of an owl in the forest was image traced and recoloured in Illustrator to give this dark, enchanted/mystical abstract vibe.

                After being given the general layout, I designed this fansite below to demonstrate grids, links, two-tiered navigation menus, adding videos, 
                adding images, creating tables, responsiveness, and more.
