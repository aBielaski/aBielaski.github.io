            <h2> Prototyped Mobile App Game Design - Selkie Quest </h2>

            <p> 
                In this project, my group needed to create a game related to Selkies (an ancient Irish mythological creature that can 
                shift from seal to human by shedding their skin when they leave the sea).  Because Selkie’s are charming and hardworking,
                the family who the Selkie was living with moved its sealskin across town to keep the Selkie from going back to the sea.  The Selkie must battle opponents
                along the way to get it back but can enlist the help of other mythological creatures (that the player has in their card deck).  The screen prototypes below 
                were designed by me and are for the use cases: purchasing a card package & playing the single player story mode.  My inspiration behind this design was a blue 
                water background for the seal, the gold border for ancient mythology, and the land is an image of Ireland because it was ancient *Irish* mythology.

            <p>
                I created this app for leaders to keep track of all members involved in a group trip, the excursions planned, and to do items.  I chose a tropical picture background with sandy
                back colours for everything else to give a vacation feel to the app.  This program also makes use of forms, validations, and saves information to MySQL so it can be retrieved
                each time the app is opened.

            <h2> Prototyped Mobile App Design - Change-It-Up </h2>

            <p> 
                Below is my design for an application in which users can upload pictures of their clothes and put outfits together.  The app keeps track of when 
                something was worn last and will generate outfit suggestions that haven't been worn in a while (based on the weather) to remove the morning stress of trying to think of something new to wear.

            <p> 
                This prototype was developed for a telepathic game called "Turn Up the Heat!" In this use case, one player chooses a fish and the other player
                has to try and guess the same fish/target.  Each time they are wrong, their brain heats up and once the match is over, the loser's mind is blown up.

            <p> 
                An illustration created by me in which the lifejacket is around the ocean to signify that we need to protect it.  Since the main theme was the ocean,
                I used the image trace function to separate the land segments and then created a clipping mask to display fishes underneath the ocean in place of the land.
                I drew the lifejacket myself using the curvature tool.

                The graphs were created in Microsoft Excel and modified for aesthetic appeal then transferred over to Photoshop where I put it all together into
                a dashboard design.  The logo was also created by me and is a surveillance camera with a bubble/network graph inside in the shape of a drone.  It was
                meant to signify the monitoring of data for a smart home appliance company.

            <p> 
                The assignment was to design a website to market a new IT post-secondary school in San Marino to prospective students and their parents around the world using the
                country's culture and topology.  I used the Apennine mountains in the website header and the tower notches above the navigation to simulate the viewer gazing upon the 
                gorgeous view of San Marino, medieval-like fonts for a culture that enjoys medieval culture, and an ancient book transparent in the background to add texture, match with 
                the republic’s heritage status, and to symbolize education.  My logo was made to reflect the three famous Monte Titano castles and is a 'U' for university but also a
                castle arch with 3 peaks if you flip it upside down.

                An advertisement for the service of hair colouring/dye at a salon.  I took a normal portrait of a girl and used the image trace function in Illustrator, set to black and
                white.  This removed the body and allowed me to draw focus to the hair and segment the image to colour individual strands.
