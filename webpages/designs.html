            <h2> Prototyped Mobile App Game Design 1 </h2>

            <p> 
                This was a group project in which we had to create a game related to Selkies.  The two use cases we chose to develop further
                were purchasing a card package in the store and the single player story mode.  I volunteered to design the prototypes, as shown below.

            <h2> Prototyped Mobile App Game Design 2 </h2>

            <p> 
                This prototype was developed for the use case "take turns guessing the other player's target" in a telepathic game where
                the loser's mind becomes heated and is blown up.

            <h2> Prototyped Mobile App Design </h2>

            <p> 
                My design for an application in which users can upload pictures of their clothes and put outfits together.  The app will generate outfit
                suggestions to remove the morning stress of trying to think of something new to wear.
